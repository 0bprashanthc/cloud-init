# NOTE: this should not require no_ntpdate feature, use 'which' to check for

# NOTE: lsb_release listed here because with recent cloud-init deb with
#       (LP: 1628337) resolved, cloud-init will attempt to configure archives.
#       this fails without lsb_release as UNAVAILABLE is used for $RELEASE
